#Report of Work

On first task, I try to do a simple commit.

Then, I try to make change Readme on new branch(develop) and do commit.

After that, I merge the 'develop' into 'master' and push it remotely.

I add more random thing on readme in develop branch and do commit and merge to practice.

Lastly, I remove Readme file and replace my work content with report file.
